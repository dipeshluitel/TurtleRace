# TurtleRace 🐢🏁
TurtleRace is a fun, interactive Python game where users can guess which turtle will win a race. Built using Python's turtle graphics, this project introduces randomness and excitement as five colorful turtles race across the screen to the finish line. Test your luck and see if you can predict the winning turtle!

### Features
- User Guess Input: Before the race begins, users can input their guess for which turtle (color) they think will win.
* Randomized Race: Each turtle advances by a random distance in each step, making every race unpredictable.
+ Interactive Feedback: After the race, a message displays whether the user’s guess was correct or not.

### How to Run
- Clone this repository.
* Run the main.py file in a Python environment.
+ Enter your guess in the pop-up window and watch the turtles race to the finish line!
